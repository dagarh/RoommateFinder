## Communications Plan

### Working team meetings
These meetings form the core of the team’s collaboration and can be used for brainstorming, pair-programming, debugging, prototyping, internal reviews of each other’s work, etc.  Except for the weekly status meetings, these are done without the manager’s (the instructor) involvement.   Often it can be done by the team during the time of the scheduled class while other teams are having status meetings, but this may not be convenient if the team is a hybrid mix where some members are on campus while others are remote.   

Whether you have your working meetings during class time or not, each team should also agree upon some recurring time(s) when to meet to work as a group in case it is needed.   State here what has been agreed upon for the working team meetings.

### Issues meetings
If a problem does arise, never surprise your manager.  Schedule a meeting at his or her earliest convenience.  This section describes how alerts will arise and the governance of when to trigger an alert – usually after a discussion at a working team meeting.

### Status meetings
Status meetings are meetings where the project manager and/or project leader reports on status to the instructor.   These will occur weekly over the duration of the project during scheduled class time with the entire team present so they can all speak to any questions of status to the instructor.

## Timeline and Milestones

Look forward for the next 10 to 13 weeks and plan out a set of target milestones (estimated) that the team expects to meet over the duration of the project, culminating in the final presentation at the end of the semester.
